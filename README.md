# React Native Lightbulb Toggle

https://github.com/jamielife/react-native-toggle/assets/411922/9f6dec3f-1834-4745-9f02-03eaafcd60f1

Simple react native toggle using React Native. Package uses Native Base & Material Icons, however any alterantive should work. 
[See Snack Code](https://snack.expo.dev/@jamielife/rn-nb-darklight-toggle?platform=web). 

## Installation

1. Clone Repo (or copy code/dependencies).
2. Run `NPM Install` or `Yarn Add` to install dependencies.

## Notes

- Any alternative to Native Base *should* work, however I have not tested this. You should be able to test easily by editing [here](https://snack.expo.dev/@jamielife/rn-nb-darklight-toggle?platform=web).
- Any icons should work as well, though matching shape and size will look best.
